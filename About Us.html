        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Loyola Jesuit College (LJC) is part of the worldwide family of Jesuit schools run by the Society of Jesus in Abuja, Nigeria in Africa. With them, it shares a common vision and philosophy derived from the writings of the founder of the Jesuits, St. Ignatius of Loyola. All Jesuit schools and their alumni are linked internationally, regionally and nationally and share development programs in common. Although all Jesuit schools are linked in that they draw from the same educational philosophies, each school is unique in the way that it adapts to its particular circumstances. The Mission Statement and other contents of this website which flow from it are our attempt to be both authentically Jesuit and relevant to the Nigerian society that we serve.

        Loyola Jesuit College is a co-educational boarding secondary school in the Jesuit tradition. The college opened with JSS-1 in 1996, and now has over 600 students in JSS-1 to SSS-3. It is a full boarding school, with teaching and supervision from members of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in collaboration with the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus and dedicated lay teachers and staff.
        
        The school is located in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria in Africa, situated on a beautiful 28.5-hectare site in the village of Gidan Mangoro. The school provides an atmosphere conducive to focused learning. Spacious athletic fields, a stream that runs alongside the property, and creatively designed buildings that complement the natural beauty of the landscape help to make Loyola Jesuit College a beautiful and effective educational learning environment.</p>
